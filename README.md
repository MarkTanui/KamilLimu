_#### let's jump to the good part_

### NFTs

NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENs

>
> Why does fungible sound like a fungi or bacteria of some wierd sort. _really, it's not_
>
> __Fungible token__
>
> A non-fungible token (NFT) is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a [`blockchain`][blockchain], a form of digital ledger, that can be sold and traded

> Okay. Let me make it a bit simpler. Asumme Mark has a note of one hundred kenya shillings, and Tanui also has another note of a hundred kenya shillings. This means that Mark can give Tanui his note and Tanui gives him his, and both would walk away having 'different' notes, but of equal value.

> Now, that's a fungible token. Different paper notes, of equal value and can be exchanged without either losingtheir value.
> 
> __Non-fungible token__
>
> Now, that we know what a fungible token is, a non-fungible tokeen is the opposite of it.
>
> A one of a kind token - item. Trading it with another, you'd end up with something completely different.
>
> __What might this token be ?__
>
> NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art.
>
> But of course, you'd [`tokenize`][tokenize] your tweet and sell it.
>
> __Where do you trade - buy or sell- your tokens ?__ 
>
> Market places. That's where you trade tokens. Think of it as a supermaret where you get in, _with money ofcourse_ and get what your eyes like.
>
> [`Opensea`][opensea] is the most known and used market place for NFTs.
>
> Money in the market places, is in [`crypto`][crypto]. You'll need to purchase some and have it in a wallet. Most markets, use [`MetaMask`][metamask] wallet.
>
> __Then...__
>
> As the market dictates, your token(s) gets higher value if its demand increases. It's sold to the highest bidder.
